Cloud - IaaS

Public Cloud - AWS

Data Center is also known as availability zone(AZ).
------------------------
Cloud uses Multi-tenancy
Namespaces concept is used, which gives tenants the feel they are the owner of the resources.

Computer As A Service (CaaS)
Elastic Compute Cloud - EC2 - can get RAM, CPU

Storage (Data Persistent)-
1. Object
2. File
3. Block

Block Storage- is Like HDD, Pendrive.
Storage As A Service / Block Storage As A Service

Elastic Block Storage (EBS) - analogy, pendrive on the cloud.
EBS is a sub service

Network As A Service - VPC - Virtual Private Cloud

Setup and booting the OS - OS Provisioning
On Laptop its known as OS
On Cloud its known as Instance/VM/OS

Network Interface Card
Elastic Network Interfaces (ENI)
Bootable Images - Amazon Machine Image (AMI)


OS Launch
Step1: Create Security Key
Step2: Launch OS - EC2
EC2 -Ram & CPU but Subservice is EBS

-----------------------------------------------------------
Everything ..every action is an event. - AWS track almost all the event.
Event- Event history contains the activities taken by people, groups, or
       AWS services in supported services in your AWS account.
Service that does this is CloudTrail.

Types of Storage:
1. File System
2. Block - Partition - Install O.S(We require ephemeral storage) in AWS - root storage
3. Object - Just want to create file. Eg - GDrive, DropBox
S3 - Simple Storage Service
Openstack - Swift

Secruity Group
By-deafult:
inbound/ingress traffic is not allowed
in AWS context firewall is security group

Analogy- Security Guard. Checks for ID and then Allow ortherwise doesnt allow to enter in the society.

JSON Parser - JQ

ay@Neelkanth:~/HybridComputing/AWS$ jq "" my.json 
{
  "name": "ay",
  "id": 1
}
ay@Neelkanth:~/HybridComputing/AWS$ jq "." my.json 
{
  "name": "ay",
  "id": 1
}
ay@Neelkanth:~/HybridComputing/AWS$ jq ".name" my.json 
"ay"


S3
Bucket
Edge Location
CDN - Content Delivery Network

CloudFront is the service used to achieve CDN from AWS.

GlobalAccelarator is yet another service to leverage the strong and secure private network developed for communication between AZs and Edge nodes.


Docker inside the AMI

Snapshot - Incremental Backup
Point in time backup

Copying Snapshot
Creating volume out of Snapshot
Changing the region of Snapshot



-------------------------------------
Elastic Kubernetes Service (Amazon EKS)
-------------------------------------

Elastic File System (EFS) - NFS protocol
Whereas S3 works on HTTP protocol

iSCSI protocol
iSCSI stands for Internet Small Computer Systems Interface. iSCSI is a transport layer protocol that works on top of the Transport Control Protocol (TCP).
It enables block-level SCSI data transport between the iSCSI initiator and the storage target over TCP/IP networks.


Fibre Channel
Fibre Channel is a high-speed networking technology primarily used for transmitting data among data centers, computer servers, switches and storage at data rates of up to 128 Gbps.


ELB
Elastic Load Balancer

Service in K8s is like load balancer

Private Subnet - Nobody can access EC2 outside AWS Data centers

Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)

A DMZ, short for demilitarized zone, is a network (physical or logical) used to connect hosts that provide an interface to an untrusted external network – usually the internet – while keeping the internal,
private network – usually the corporate network – separated and isolated form the external network.

As systems that are most vulnerable to attack are those that provide services to users outside of the local area network, such as e-mail, Web and Domain Name System (DNS) servers,
they are ‘quarantined’ inside a DMZ, from where they have limited access to the private network. Hosts in the DMZ can communicate with both the internal and external network,
but communications with internal network hosts is tightly restricted.

The DMZ is isolated using a security gateway (i.e. firewall) to filter traffic between the DMZ and the private network. The DMZ itself also has a security gateway in front of it to filter incoming traffic from the external network.
The ultimate goal of a DMZ is to allow access to resources from untrusted networks while keeping the private network secured. Resources commonly placed in the DMZ include, Web servers, Mail servers, FTP servers, and VoIP servers.
